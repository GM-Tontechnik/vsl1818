Usage:
------

1. connect your VSL 1818 AudioBox
2. start VSL on your computer
3. run "python vsl1818.py" on the same computer
4. load http://localhost:8000 in your web browser
5. poke around

You can adjust levels (master, aux3/4, aux5/6, aux7/8), panning,
and the high-pass filter for every channel.

You can name the channels, but the names aren't sent to VSL.  Instead
the names are just used for all the clients connected to this program.
